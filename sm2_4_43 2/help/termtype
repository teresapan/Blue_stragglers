Syntax: TERMTYPE WORD [ NLINES ]

   Set the terminal type for the line/history editor to be WORD. The
WORD argument is taken to be an entry in the termcap file used to
describe terminals to editors and SM. Using TERMTYPE is exactly
equivalent to setting the TERM environment variable (Unix) or the TERM
logical (VMS).  If WORD can't be found, the previous TERMTYPE remains
in force (or "dumb" if nothing can be found). WORD is case sensitive.
The special type "none" disables the command editor; this can be useful
on really dumb terminals such as vt240s or genuine TEK 4010s.

   If the optional NLINES is provided, it specifies the number of
lines on the screen to SM. If you are using a window system, for
instance, this may differ from that found in termcap.  Additionally,
specifying a negative NLINES turns off any attempt to move the alpha
cursor. This may be useful if you find the cursor ending up in funny
places after drawing graphs.
