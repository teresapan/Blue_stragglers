Syntax: FOREACH variable ( list ) { commands }
or      FOREACH variable { list } { commands }
or      FOREACH variable vector { commands }

   The two forms with lists define variable as each element of the
list is in turn, and then the commands are executed. An example would be
	FOREACH var ( alpha 2 gamma ) { WRITE STANDARD $var }

   The version with {} surrounding the list is useful whenever you
want the list to appear exactly as you typed it.

   With a vector, the variable is defined to be each element of the vector
in turn, e.g.
        SET x=0,10 FOREACH var x { echo $var }
