Subject: Re:  Bison documentation?

The main difference between Bison and Yacc that I know of is that
Bison supports the @n construction, which gets you the nth item
>from the parse stack.

The differences in the algorithms stem mainly from the horrible
kludges that Johnson had to perpetrate to make Yacc fit in a PDP-11.
Also, Bison uses a faster but less space-efficient encoding for the
parse tables (see Corbett's PhD thesis from Berkeley, "Static
Semantics in Compiler Error Recovery", June 1985, Report No. UCB/CSD
85/251), and more modern technique for generating the lookahead sets
(see "Efficient Construction of LALR(1) Lookahead Sets" by F. DeRemer
and A. Pennello; their technique is the standard one now.  I don't
remember anymore where their paper first appeared but it is well
known.
