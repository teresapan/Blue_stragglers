Syntax: KEY key-sequence commands

   Define the key-sequence to expand to the commands. If the commands
end with `\N', they are immediately executed. Hitting <CR> immediately
after the KEY is also allowed; you'll be prompted for the rest
(without the editor seeing the key-sequence first). Or you could quote
the beginning of the key sequence with the `quote_next' character
(usually ^Q and ESC-q). If the key-sequence is pf# or PF# (where # is
1, 2, 3, or 4) it is taken to refer to a special function key on your
keyboard.
