Syntax : CHDIR WORD

   Change to a new directory. From now on, commands such as DATA or
MACRO WRITE will refer to WORD. It might be wise to enclose WORD in
double quotes. If the first character of WORD is `~' it is replaced by
your home directory. The macro `cd' provides the quotes automatically,
e.g. `cd ../data'
