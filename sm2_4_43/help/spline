Syntax: SPLINE x1 y1 x2 y2

   Perform a natural spline fit on vectors x1 and y1, which must have
the same dimension, where x1 must be monotonic increasing. Then
interpolate the spline to the points specified by vector x2, creating
the new vector y2. Beyond the ends of x, linear interpolation is used.
