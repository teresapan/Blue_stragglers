  *** SVGA.DLL ***

  This DLL is designed to support ALL video cards.  The preformance of
  this DLL is slightly less than the card-specific DLLs but it has a
  broader range.  If there is a specific DLL that supports your card,
  then you should use that one, since it will probably be faster than
  this one.

  This DLL will support any Video card/mode using some undocumented
  Windows functions that force the Windows display driver to do the mode
  switching.  The Windows screen is saved into a full screen sized
  bitmap using the BitBlt API call.  It also uses 2 DCs throughout the
  life of the debugger, so if you use more than 2-3 DCs in your program
  and you see weird things happening, then you'll want to disable the
  BitBlt option below.  On Coprocessor cards (or those that are
  advertised as "Windows Accelerators") the responce time is fairly
  quick even in 1024x768 modes.  On non-coprocessor cards, the higher
  the resolution, the longer it will take for the screen switch to
  occure.  (By screen switch, I mean the transition from the Windows
  screen to the Debugger screen and/or vice versa.)  There are some
  options that can be specified in the TDW.INI file under the
  [VideoOptions] section, that may help improve preformance:

    BitBlt=Y|N          - Y saves the bitmap, N doesn't.

                        This is on by default and only needs to be
                        specified in order to disable it.  If disabled,
                        it prevents the DLL from allocating the bitmap,
                        the DCs or from saving the entire screen each
                        screen swap.  If you disable this, you will not
                        see anything on the user screen (Alt-F5) until
                        you run the program and control goes back to
                        Windows.

    ForceRepaint=Y|N    - Y Forces Windows to repaint the screen, N doesn't.

                        This option is on by default and only takes
                        effect if BitBlt disabled.  This is what forces
                        Windows to repaint the whole screen when your
                        program is run and you are not saving the whole
                        screen in the bitmap.  If you disable this
                        option, you won't see anything on the Windows
                        screen until your program invalidates something
                        and repaints it.

    ROWS=xx             25, 43, or 50 rows on the screen.  Warning: TDW
                        will abide by this number, so don't specify
                        something that your screen will not handle.

    XGA=Y|N             - Set this to 'Y' only on an XGA card.

  On XGA, TIGA, and other high powered coprocessor cards, the BitBlt
  option should be fast enough to use pleasantly.

  Known problems: None, the XGA problem has been fixed.  If the XGA=Yes
                  switch is enabled, then TDW will behave in all XGA
                  modes.  The mouse can now be used as usual.
