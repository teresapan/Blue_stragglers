Syntax: ERASE

   ERASE erases the graphics screen. The macro "era"
erases the screen without appearing on the history buffer.

   You may be able to erase individual lines with LTYPE ERASE.

   See PAGE for starting a new page on a hardcopy device.

   If the variable raise_on_erase is set and false, the graphics
window won't be deiconified and raised when it is erased.
