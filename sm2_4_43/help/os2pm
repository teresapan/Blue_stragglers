Syntax: DEVICE os2pm [args]

   The OS2PM driver is used to display graphics in a Presentation Manger
graphics window under OS/2 v2.x. Two optional arguments are currently supported.

	-n	Disable all backing for the graphics window. This will
		significantly increase the drawing speed, but the contents
 		of the graphics window will not be redrawn when portions of 
		the window are uncovered or when the window is resized.

	-gWxH	Specify the window geometry. The W and H parameters should
		contains the WIDTH and HEIGHT of the graphics window in
		pixels. 

If DEVICE os2pm is specified without the -gWxH argument the graphics window
will be created the same size as the last previously displayed window. If
this is the first time the graphics window is created it will default to
600 x 400 pixels.

Example:	DEVICE os2pm -g800x500
		.
		.
		.
		DEVICE os2pm -n

	The first DEVICE statement will produce an 800 x 500 pixel graphics
 	window with backing enabled. The second will again produce an 800 x 500
	pixel window but with no backing.
