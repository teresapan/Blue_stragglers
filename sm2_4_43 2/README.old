This is the top level SM directory, and contains various useful files
in addition to those needed to run SM.

To install SM, see sm.install

The other files in this directory are a miscellany:
AA_Version.h		Used in upkeep of SM
.config			The options used to make SM; updated automatically
Makefile		Used with the Unix make programme to compiling SM
abbrev			Make a macro file of all unambiguous abbreviations
callable		Directory of examples of linking the SM libraries
compile.com		Used instead of make under VMS
compile_g		A programme to pre-compile graphcap entries
config			Make the .config file
descrip.mms		A Makefile for VMS's version of make, MMS
dump			Unix adb script to decode core dumps
filecap			File describing binary file formats to SM
fix_options		Resets src/options.h; used by make distrib
font_index		Specify characters to use in SM's fonts
fonts.bin		Binary form of font information
get_grammar		Programme to extract Yacc grammar from .y files
graphcap		File describing graphics devices to SM
help			Directory containing SM's help files
hershey_oc.dat		File specifying all the Hershey characters for fonts
info			Directory for the documentation
kept_SM.com		Command file to run SM in a subprocess (VMS)
macro			Directory with default macros
make_patch		Shell script to make patch files
make_cvs_patch		Shell script to make patch files from cvs'd sources
make_tags		Shell script to make emacs-style tag files for SM macro
maps.dat		File specifying keyboard mappings for SM
maps_vms.dat		File specifying keyboard mappings for SM, for DCL users
old_font_index		Like font_index, but for the old fonts
rasterise		Programme to process SM raster files
read_fonts		Programme to make fonts.bin files
rename_sm		Script to add a prefix to all functions in callable SM
set_opts		Script to set SM up on a new machine
sm_to_vms		Ftp script to move SM to a VMS system
sm2fd			Copy SM source to floppy disks
sm.install		Installation instructions made from info/install.txi
sm.el			Gnuemacs lisp functions for editing SM macros
sm.man			Unix manual page for SM (use nroff -man sm.man)
sm.pps			Definitions for printing SM files using pps
			(A public domain postscript pretty-printer. Rename
			sm.pps sm.l and compile it like pps's c.l).
src			Directory containing source code
termcap			File describing terminals, for systems without termcaps
tex.defs		File defining the pre-loaded `TeX' definitions.
unix.sm			Example .sm file for unix
vgdefs			Definitions for printing SM macros with unix's vgrind
vms.sm			Example .sm file for VMS

You don't need all of these on disk! In fact the minimum that you need
to run SM is the sm executable, the font.bin file, graphcap,
filecap, (and maybe termcap), and the macro and help directories.  The
remaining files are source for everything, including the manual,
various utilities (e.g. to make binary font files, or to pre-compile
graphcap entries, or the patch utility to install updates), and
various useful files (e.g. example keymap files and .sm)

MACHINES

We expect SM to build on anything (well, almost anything). Here's a list
of recent builds. It probably isn't complete.
