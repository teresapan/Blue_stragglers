Syntax: DEVICE sunview [ args ]

  The SunView window driver supports a subset of the usual SunView
command line arguments, specifically:

    -WH               Summarise options
    -Wi               Open window as an icon
    -Wl label         Specify label for the window (default: SM)
    -Wn               Don't label window
    -WP x y           Position of icon
    -Wp x y           Position of window
    -Ws w h           Size of window

The standard SunView popup `frame' menu has been modified to allow you
to erase the graphics screen. It is perfectly safe to use the menu to
quit the graphics window, in this case the next `device sunview'
command will create a new one. If SM thinks that the window is active
when you try to kill it it will warn you; failing to believe it may
result in a cascade of complaints to the console window.
