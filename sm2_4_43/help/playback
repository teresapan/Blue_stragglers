   To replay the list use the macro `playback' (or `play'). This will
repeat all the commands that you can see with the command HISTORY (or
`lis'). A common way of getting hard copies of plots would be to say
`dev hard_copy_device' then `playback' then `dev other_device', or to
use the `hcopy' macro.

   Playback is one of a number of commands which manipulate the special
macro `all', HELP all describes others.
