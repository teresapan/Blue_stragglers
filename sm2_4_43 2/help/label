Syntax: LABEL str

   LABEL writes the string str (which starts one space after LABEL and
continues to the last non-space character) at the current location
(set by RELOCATE, etc). The string's size and angle are determined by
EXPAND and ANGLE. The character "\" is an escape character and causes
the following actions:

        \\x - set mode x
        \x  - set mode x for next char only
        \r - roman font
        \g - greek font
        \s - script font
        \t - tiny font
        \i - toggle italics
        \u - superscript
        \d - subscript

   A better way to use special symbols is the use SM's `TeX'
strings, see the manual for details.

   If EXPAND is exactly 1, and ANGLE is exactly 0, SM will attempt to
use a hardware character set. To avoid this use EXPAND 1.0001, or
preface the string with an explicit \\r (or include a {} if using TeX
strings).
