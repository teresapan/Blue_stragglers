Syntax: DEVICE META WORD
        DEVICE META CLOSE
        META READ WORD

   If you open the special device called META it doesn't close the
current device, merely intercepts plotting commands and stores them
away as well as executing them immediately. This continues until you
issue a CLOSE command.

   The command META READ file reads a metafile and executes it on the
current device.

   Because of the way that SM interrogates devices about their
abilities, while using META all ltypes, lweights, and fonts will be
emulated in software (this guarantees that the device you playback on
will be able to handle the code). If the current device can handle
dots (i.e. PTYPE 0 0) then META will attempt to use them too, but if
it can't then META will be reduced to faking them. This could be a
serious problem, so good luck. Metafiles do not support colour, again
due to the impossibility of knowing if they will have the same
behaviour as the original device.
