Syntax: DEVICE WORD [arguments]
or      DEVICE INTEGER [ WORD ] [arguments]
or      DEVICE META WORD
or      DEVICE META CLOSE

   Choose a plot device.  The actual rules for DEVICE are a little
complex, but basically WORD specifies the driver to use. Most users
need not worry about the numeric version of this command (which may
disappear in the future anyway). If WORD is the name of a known device
it is selected, otherwise SM will use the stdgraph driver and look for
the device in graphcap (see Appendix II of the manual for details, and
a discussion of the more complex forms of this command).  Fortunately,
stdgraph is capable of driving almost all graphics terminals and
printers in use.  Extra arguments are passed to the device driver.

   The pseudo-device META is special, (try HELP meta). It is used to
support metafiles, which allow you to save a plot as you display it,
and finally send it to a different device.

   Some examples may clarify this a little. DEVICE nodevice and DEVICE
0 are equivalent, and specify the null device, which does nothing.
This is the default.  "DEVICE 1 tek4010", "DEVICE stdgraph tek4010",
and "DEVICE tek4010" are all equivalent, and specify that the device
is to be stdgraph, using the graphcap entry for a Tektronix 4010
terminal.  "DEVICE postscript laser1" specifies that the stdgraph
postscript driver be used, and that it be passed the argument "laser1"
(which it will presumably use to choose which laser printer to use).

   Use the LIST DEVICE command to see which devices are available, either
in graphcap or as hard-coded drivers. If relevant, you could try HELP x11
or help sunview.
