Syntax: LIST DEFINE [ begin end ]
or      LIST DEFINE |
or      LIST DEFINE IMAGE
or      LIST DEVICE [ pattern ]
or      LIST EDIT
or      LIST MACRO [ begin end ]
or      LIST SET
or      LIST TABLE

   List all the current variables (DEFINE) or macros (MACRO). If the
optional begin and end are present, only list things between their
initial letters.  (i.e. LIST MACRO a b will list macros beginning with
a or b). If VERBOSE is 0, macros beginning `##' will not be listed.

LIST DEFINE | lists all internal variables (LIST DEFINE itself only does
if VERBOSE >= 2). LIST DEFINE IMAGE lists all IMAGE variables (as
read from files with IMAGE or TABLE, or defined with IMAGE DEFINE name val).
FITS keywords are omitted if verbose is 0. You can use DEFINE name IMAGE
to convert these to regular SM variables.

   LIST DEVICE will list all the devices known to SM. The
possible stdgraph devices (default devices defined in graphcap) are
listed with each device on an (indented) line, first the primary name,
then a list of aliases in parentheses, then a full name. If a pattern
is provided, only those output lines matching the pattern will be printed;
patterns are described under APROPOS.

   LIST EDIT will list current key bindings, either just those that
are changed from the default (VERBOSE = 1), all control characters
(VERBOSE = 1), or everything (VERBOSE >= 2). Any keyboard macros (KEY)
are also listed.

   LIST SET will list all the current vectors, giving their dimensions
and help strings (see SET HELP).

   LIST TABLE lists the columns in the current table that you could read
using a 'byname' format.

   For a list of the history buffer use HISTORY (macro "lis"), to list
a macro use HELP.
