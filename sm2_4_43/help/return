Syntax: RETURN

   Return from the current macro, which includes breaking out of DO
and FOREACH loops. If you are not executing a macro, simply return to
the prompt (this is more-or-less equivalent to typing ^C).

   A RETURN can be useful while playing with history lists. Note that
many of the commands such as playback in fact are executing a macro
called "all". A RETURN at the very end of a macro, or the playback
buffer, will cause a RETURN from the wrong place - beware!

   If VERBOSE is 2 or more, the macro being left is reported.
