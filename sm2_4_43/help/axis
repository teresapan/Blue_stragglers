Syntax: AXIS A1 A2 VSMALL VBIG AX AY ALEN ILABEL ICLOCK
or      AXIS A1 A2 VSMALL VBIG VLAB AX AY ALEN ILABEL ICLOCK
or      AXIS A1 A2 ASMALL ABIG AX AY ALEN ILABEL ICLOCK

   (You may not want to use this command at all! For example, the easy
way to label the bottom axis from 0 to 1 and the top axis from 0 to 100
is to use the command
	LIMITS 0 1 y BOX 1 2 3 0 LIMITS 0 100 0 0 BOX 0 0 1 0
You can control whether the axes are labelled logarithmically with TICKSIZE).

   Makes an axis labelled from A1 to A2 at location AX, AY, length
ALEN. The first form (with VSMALL and VBIG) specifies the values where
you want small and big ticks explicitly; if you specify the
string-valued vector VLAB it will be used to label the big ticks.  The
third form is more obscure: If ABIG > 0 use that for spacing of large
ticks.  If ASMALL < 0 make a logarithmic axis, if ASMALL = 0, do the
default. If ASMALL > 0 try to use that for the spacing of small ticks.

ILABEL is 0 for no labels, 1 for labels parallel to axis, 2 for
perpendicular to axis, and 3 for neither ticks nor labels. ANGLE
determines the angle of the axis.  You usually want the ticks
perpendicular to the axes, and this is what you get with @code{ICLOCK}
0 or 1; if it is 2 or 3 the ticks are vertical, and if 4 or 5 they are
horizontal. The labels are always on the opposite side of the axis
from the ticks unless you add 8 to the numbers given above (see the manual
for a discussion of these magic numbers in terms of bitmasks).

   For example, to draw and label the top of the default box use:
        AXIS 0 1 0 0 3500 31000 27500 0 1
or to draw the bottom,
	SET s=0,1,.05 SET b=0,1,.2
        AXIS 0 1 s b 3500 3500 27500 1 0
If you have used LIMITS to scale the axes and LOCATION or WINDOW to
move them, you could say something like
        AXIS $fx1 $fx2 s b $gx1 $gy1 $($gx2-$gx1) 1 0

   See NOTATION if you want to control the use of floating point
or exponential notation.  You can control the font used by setting
the variable default_font and the distance of labels from their
axes with the variable label_offset.
