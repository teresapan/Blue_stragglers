Syntax: EDIT op_name key_name

   Redefine a key key_name to carry out the function op_name. For example,
`EDIT start_of_line ^J' will make <LF> take the cursor to the start of the
line.

   Key_name is the name of the key either as a letter, a ^letter, or \nnn
where ^A is ctrl-A and nnn is in octal. The (complete) default mapping is:
   start_of_line          ^A      previous_char          ^B
                                  delete_char            ^D
