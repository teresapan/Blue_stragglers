Syntax: LOCATION GX1 GX2 GY1 GY2

   Sets the physical location of the plot. SM uses coordinates
which run from 0-32767 and LOCATION specifies where, within this
square, plots are drawn. All points and lines are truncated outside
this region. The default value is LOCATION 3500 31000 3500 31000.

   In order to put labels outside this region use the RELOCATE ( x y )
command.

   If you want to increase the x-location by 500 (say), you can say:
        LOCATION $($gx1 + 500) $gx2 $gy1 $gy2
This is sometimes useful to make room for an axis label; if your verbosity
is 1 or higher you'll be advised of the appropriate displacement.
