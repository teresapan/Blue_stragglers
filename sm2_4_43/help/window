Syntax: WINDOW nx ny x y

   Divide the plotting area into nx*ny regions, and use the (x,y)th.
The division is dependent upon the current EXPAND, so make sure that
you have the same EXPAND for each of a set of WINDOW commands.  Note
that the syntax has changed from Mongo.

   If the number of boxes desired in x or y (nx and/or ny) is negative,
the boxes will be drawn touching in that direction.

   If either x or y is specified as, e.g. 2:4, the window is set to
cover the range 2-4 (i.e. the part of the screen covered by windows 2,
3, and 4). Note that this feature can be used to split the screen in
arbitrary ways, e.g.
	window -1 -6 1 1:5 box
	window -1 -6 1 6 box

   After we calculate the spacing between the windows, we multiply the
results by the value of `x_gutter' or `y_gutter', so if you think
that the spacing is too large in the x direction you can say
        define x_gutter 0.5
        window 2 2 1 1 box
        window 2 2 1 2 box
to make things look better.

   The windows are not reset upon changing devices - use WINDOW 1 1 1 1
if you want to do so. This is also recommended before using LOCATION.
