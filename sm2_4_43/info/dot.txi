@pindex Dot

   Draw a point at the current location (set by RELOCATE, DRAW, etc.) in the
style determined by PTYPE. The point's size and rotation are governed by
EXPAND and ANGLE.

To insert dots into labels, it may be easier to use the `@TeX{}'
definition @code{\point} or @code{\apoint} which inserts a dot of a
specified PTYPE into a string (@pxref{Fonts}).
