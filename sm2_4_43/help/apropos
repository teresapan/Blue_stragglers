Syntax : APROPOS pattern

   Apropos lists all macros whose name or introductory comments match
the given pattern.

   If your system supports it, APROPOS will also search the help files
for the given string (in this case matches may not extend over more
than one line). If VERBOSE is zero only the line containing the match
is printed; if VERBOSE is one or more then a couple of lines on each
side of the match are printed too. If you use `q' to stop looking at
the help files APROPOS will proceed to search the macros.

The pattern is a slightly restricted version of a
normal Unix regular expression, specifically:

	.	Matches any character except \n
	[...]	Matches any of the characters listed in ... .
		  If the first character is a ^ it means use anything except
		the range specified (in any other position ^ isn't special)
		  A range may be specified with a - (e.g. [0-9]), and if a ]
		is to be part of the range, it must appear first (or after
		the leading ^, if specified). A - may appear as a [---].
	^	Matches only at the start of the string
	$	Matches only at the end of a string
	\t	Tab
	\n	Newline
	\.	(any other character) simply escapes the character (e.g. \^)
	*	Any number of the preceeding character (or range)
	?	One or more of the preceeding character or range

(Of course, characters such as " and # that are special to SM must also
be quoted e.g. APROPOS "^#.*quit" or APROPOS ^\#.*quit).

By default searches are case insensitive, but you can make searching
sensitive to case by deleting the variable case_fold_search (you can do this
by putting a line "case_fold_search 0" in your .sm file if you so desire).
