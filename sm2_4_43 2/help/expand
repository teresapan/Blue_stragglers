Syntax: EXPAND expr

   EXPAND expands all characters and points, its default is 1.0. Note
that the EXPAND factor is used in determining the plot window size in
the WINDOW command, so EXPAND should be the same for each of a set of
WINDOW commands.

   If EXPAND is exactly 1, and ANGLE is exactly 0, SM will use
hardware character sets if possible. To frustrate this, set expand
1.001.

   EXPAND can in fact be given a vector of values, which are used for
each point in a POINTS command. This supercedes the use of a fractional
PTYPE (although we still support it as a quaint anachronism).
