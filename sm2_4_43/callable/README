This directory contains examples of calling sm functions from
programs.  They have probably all be tested once on one architecture,
but we wouldn't want to make any further claim as to their reliability
as examples.  In particular, it is imperative that you read the
appendix in the manual that deals with calling SM from programs.  The
examples given here may not even have the correct function names,
since those are dependent on the o/s on which SM was built, and on
decisions made by the SM administrator when s/he built it.

Note that there are two versions of the fortran test, one in single (test)
and one in double preciaion (testd). You MUST use the proper SM libraries
to link against! (And remember, there's a unix builtin called test, so
you must say ./test to run it; sorry).

tkSM is a test application for SM's TK device. After building the executable,
you can say
      tkSM smtk.tcl
to generate a Tk application with two SM widgets in it. Much as I dislike
GUIs, I must say that I think it's rather cute. Do use it, you must have
built SM with Tk enabled, which will require you to have the TCL/Tk include
files and libraries installed on your system.
