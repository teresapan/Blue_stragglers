Syntax: PUTLABEL INTEGER str

   PUTLABEL writes a label at the current location with rotation and
size specified by ANGLE and EXPAND (exactly like LABEL). The label is
oriented with respect to the current location according to the
argument INTEGER which can be 1 - 9 for:
               label to left     centre     right
        label above      7         8         9 
              centered   4         5         6
              below      1         2         3
(cf. a vt100 keypad). If INTEGER is 0 the string isn't actually drawn,
but the string's dimensions are calculated (and are available as
$swidth, $sheight, and $sdepth), and any TeX definitions are remembered.

   If EXPAND is exactly 1, and ANGLE is exactly 0, SM will attempt to
use a hardware character set. To avoid this use EXPAND 1.0001, or
preface the string with an explicit \\r (or include a {} if you are
using TeX strings).
