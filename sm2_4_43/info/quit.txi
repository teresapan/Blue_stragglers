@node Quit, Range, Putlabel, Commands

@iftex
@syntax Quit.
@end iftex
@example
Syntax: QUIT 
@end example
@pindex Quit
@findex exiting SM, quit
Quits the programme entirely.

The macro `q' is defined as something like
@example
DELETE HISTORY DEFINE 1 0     # default value
DEFINE 1 ? @{ Are you sure? Enter 1 to really quit @}
IF($1) @{ QUIT @} 
@end example
@noindent
so you won't quit accidently, and the QUIT won't appear
in the history file. This is an obvious candidate for overloading.
