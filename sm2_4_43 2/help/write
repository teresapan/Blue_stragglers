Syntax: WRITE HISTORY WORD
or      WRITE STANDARD
or      WRITE [+] WORD
or      WRITE IMAGE WORD
or      WRITE TABLE [+] WORD { vector [ vector ... ] }

   WRITE HISTORY WORD writes the macro WORD onto the top of the history buffer.

   WRITE STANDARD writes a string to the standard output. The string
is taken to be the rest of the line up to a carriage return (which may
be written explicitly as \n). WRITE filename is similar, but it writes
the string to a file. If the filename is the same as the last time
that you used this command, or if you preface the filename with a `+',
the string is appended; otherwise the file is overwritten.

   WRITE IMAGE WORD writes the current image to file WORD.

   WRITE TABLE writes the specified vector(s) to file WORD; with + they
are appended to the file.  All current IMAGE variables (as defined with
IMAGE DEFINE) are written to the table header. Currently only FITS binary
tables are supported.

   For WRITE macro_name, see MACRO (or maybe SAVE).
