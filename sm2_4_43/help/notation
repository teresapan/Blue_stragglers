Syntax: NOTATION XLO XHI YLO YHI

   Set axis label format (exponential or floating). By default, all
numbers between 1e-4 and 1e4 are written as floating point numbers,
and all numbers outside this range are written with an exponent. This
corresponds to a NOTATION -4 4 -4 4 command.

   If you set XLO=XHI and/or YLO=YHI, all values on that axis will be
plotted using exponents (unless [XY]LO and [XY]HI are both 0, when the
notation on that axis will be reset)
