Syntax: BOX [ INTEGER INTEGER [ INTEGER INTEGER ] ]

   BOX puts axes around the plot region, labelling the lower and left
according to the values set by LIMITS and TICKSIZE. If the arguments
are included (default 1 2 0 0) they are used as ILABEL arguments for
the bottom, left, top and right hand axes respectively, where 0 means
no labels, 1 and 2 specify the direction of ticks (see AXIS), 3
means omit both tickmarks and labels, and 4 means omit the axis entirely.

See NOTATION if you want to control the use of floating point
or exponential notation.
