Syntax: DEVICE x11 [ args ]

  The X11 window driver (device x11) supports a subset of the standard
command line arguments, specifically:

    #geom             Specify icon geometry
    -bd n             Border width
    -bg colour        Background colour
    -cmap             Use a private colour map for this device
    -colormap         Use a private colour map for this device (same as -cmap)
    -colourmap        Use a private colour map for this device (same as -cmap)
    -device n         Use X11-device n
    -display name     Name of display to open
    -fg colour        Foreground colour
    -fn name          Name of font to use
    -geometry geom    Specify window geometry
    -kbdfocus         Preserve keyboard focus (the same as -focus)
    -help             Summarise options
    -iconic           Open window as an icon
    -name name        Specify name of window
    -ndevice n        Allow up to n X11-devices
    -nocurswind	      Do NOT show the cursor position in cursor mode
		      (same as -nocw)
    -preopened display_id:window_id
                      Specify device and window id's
    -synchronise      Synchronise with server (debugging only)
    -title title      Specify title of window

where `geom' is a standard geometry string of the form `WxH+-X+-Y',
and the preopened option is for a programme calling SM
non-interactively.  All options may be abbreviated, so
	device x11 -i #-1+1 -g 512x512+100+100
specifies that the graphics window be created as an icon in the top
right hand corner of the screen, and that the real window should be
512x512 and positioned near the top left corner.

Reopening (`dev x11'), erasing the screen, or the PAGE command will
raise SM's graphics window.

On hardware that doesn't support a backing store (or if you have
chosen to disable a backing store when compiling the X11 driver) the
screen will only be refreshed when it is active or SM is awaiting
input.
