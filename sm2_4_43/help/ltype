Syntax: LTYPE INTEGER
or      LTYPE ERASE
or      LTYPE EXPAND number

   All lines (except for those making up axes and characters) are
drawn with line type INTEGER, meaning:

        0 = solid
        1 = dot
        2 = short dash
        3 = long dash
        4 = dot - short dash
        5 = dot - long dash
        6 = short dash - long dash
	10  erase lines

   LTYPE ERASE is equivalent to LTYPE 10, and will erase any lines
that are redrawn (e.g. LTYPE 0 BOX LTYPE ERASE BOX will first draw a
box, and then erase it). Not all devices can support erasing
individual lines, if yours doesn't you'll have to ERASE the whole
screen.

   LTYPE EXPAND makes all dots, dashes, and spaces in the chosen ltype
larger (or smaller) by the value specified.
