Syntax: SHOW 
@end example
@pindex Show

   List the values of some of the internal variables, including
current location
and plot region limits in user and device coordinates, the value of
the expansion and angle variables, the line type and weight, and the
physical limits. Show is actually a macro, so you could modify
it to your own ends, for example listing the current data file too.
