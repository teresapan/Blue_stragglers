Borland Graphics on a PC

Syntax: DEVICE bgi [ devtype [ mode ] ]

   SM works on a PC running DOS either by using Borland's graphics or
windows (try HELP mswindows); this section describes the former.

   The graphics drivers, the .bgi files, are assumed to be in a
directory given by the DOS BGIPATH environment variable; alternatively
you can specify a bgipath variable in your .sm file.

   The DEVICE command takes two optional arguments; the first,
devtype, is the type of hardware that you are running. If you want the
driver to try to figure this out for itself, use DEVICE bgi detect
(this is the default); for a listing of possibilities say DEVICE bgi
?. The second argument, mode, determines how SM switches between
screen and graphics modes. Your options are none, swap (the default),
or switch; experiment to see which works better for you. At present, a
certain amount of `snow' is left at the top of the graphics screen.
This is very dependent on the details of your graphics card, and we
see no general way to prevent its appearance.

   Once you have decided what options you like best, you can set a
variable stdmode in your .sm file (e.g. to detect none) to save
yourself some typing.

   There is a `hot key', ALT-F1, that can be used to toggle between
text and graphics mode.
