   These words may be upper or lower case. If word is not one of these but
is a macro or a variable, its definition or value is printed. If it is a
vector, the help string for that vector is printed (See SET HELP and PRINT).

See also APROPOS for looking for strings in macros (e.g. APROPOS Mongo).

   To get a prompt, try ^C. If very desperate indeed, ^\ (Unix) or ^Y (VMS)
might help, but at some risk...
